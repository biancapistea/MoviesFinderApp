GeoQuiz:
The app is meant to test and improve your knowledge about the countries of the world. It includes a quiz game where you can receive questions about flags/coat of arms/capitals of all the countries in the world. 
You can also select from which region (Europe, Asia, Africa etc) you want to receive questions. Also, it includes a hangman game where you need to guess the capital of the country or the country based on the flag. 
Also, it includes a training module where you can find more details about each country before taking the quiz.
